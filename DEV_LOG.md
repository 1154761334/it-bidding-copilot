# DEV_LOG

## 2026-05-07 Round 1

### Baseline
- Lowest item: `/bid` frontend contract was ahead of the FastAPI backend. Frontend called `/health`, `/projects`, `/evidence/search`, `/projects/{id}/artifacts`, and `/demo/real-case`, while backend only exposed legacy `/api/project/*` and plugin routes.
- Evidence keyword fallback used repeated filters, which made multi-keyword searches such as `ISO9001 营业执照 授权书` return 0 results.
- Frontend `pnpm run build` failed because the default script required `bun`; direct Next build also failed before SPA templates were generated.
- Existing LLM workflow could not be accepted as green after removing hardcoded credentials; it now requires `LLM_API_KEY` from the environment. No token/API key was written to code or logs.

### Changes
- Added a real `/bid` FastAPI adapter with project lifecycle, file upload, plan/approve/execute/review, evidence search, artifact listing/reading, and real-case demo endpoints.
- Generated real Markdown artifacts under ignored workspace storage: `plan.md`, `response_matrix.md`, `draft.md`, `review.md`, and `evidence_trace.json`.
- Added stable `EVID-{id}` evidence IDs to API payloads, LLM evidence context, response matrix rows, draft references, and evidence trace JSON.
- Fixed keyword evidence search to use OR-style recall across title, text, and tags, while keeping optional semantic search when an embedding key is configured.
- Removed hardcoded LLM and embedding API keys from backend config. Provider base URLs, model names, and environment variable names remain configurable.
- Added `backend/tests/api_smoke.py` and root `eval_bid_assistant.py`.
- Updated frontend build scripts to use `pnpm`; build-time server env is generated locally by `scripts/buildNextWithEnv.mts` without committing fixed token/API key values.
- Updated README to describe the current LobeChat `/bid` + FastAPI + Vault/Evidence Store architecture and mark MinIO/OVP/Hermes-style stacks as non-required for this phase.

### Verification
- `docker compose ps`: db, redis, and optional minio containers up.
- `cd backend && venv/bin/python -m src.ingest --dry-run`: PASS, 253 chunks discoverable from real Vault markdown sources.
- `cd backend && venv/bin/python tests/api_smoke.py`: PASS.
- `backend/venv/bin/python eval_bid_assistant.py`: PASS, score `100.0`, checks `18/18`, evidence trace length `64`.
- `cd frontend && pnpm run build`: PASS. Build still prints upstream QStash missing-token warnings during static collection, but exits 0.
- `cd frontend && pnpm run build:next`: PASS with generated build-time env.

### Blockers / Next
- Legacy LLM RAG script `cd backend && venv/bin/python tests/test_rag_workflow.py` is blocked until `LLM_API_KEY` is provided via environment and provider quota is available. It now fails closed instead of using hardcoded credentials.
- Next useful iteration: improve deterministic tender parsing precision and make review findings more granular for missing materials versus scoring-risk evidence.
